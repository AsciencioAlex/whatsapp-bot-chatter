# whatsapp-bot-chatter
This is a simple chatbot system based on python 
For this I used Ubuntu Operating System.
For you to use,
install selenium  -- sudo apt-get install selenium
install chrome-driver for google-chrome or gecko-driver for firefox
both should be in the same path.

--- run ---
python Whatsapp_Chat_Bot.py

it will open the official web page for whatsapp where you need to run QR Code using the whatsapp on your phone.
